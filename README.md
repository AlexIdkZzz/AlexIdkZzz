Hi, I'm Alex. :)

I'm a veeery curious person.
I like to learn new things.
I'm new on GitHub, so i don't understand literally nothing lol.
My old account it's lost 'cause i lost my 2FA code, it's sad.

You're welcome to see my profile, but momentarily it's only for school, so... I think you're welcome. (:
